# Introduction

A group of goods that will be transported together, with one sender and one receiver unit. It could be considered as Freight, Cargo or Load. Consignment(CSM) can consist of customer orders, or Handling Materials  or replenishment orders or any other type of goods to be transported. Every item within a CSM transported together, all of them are picked up from one location and dropped off at one location.

In the context of this solution, we call those products and services that will compose a consignment - such as a shipment - "[Consignable Units](#consignable-units)". Check [here](#currently-supported-types-of-consignable-units) what are the current supported types of Consignable Units.

In short, this solution will help you:

- Store the transactions you want to consign (Consignable Units)
- Manage the prices associated with its cost calculations
- Rate the Consignable Units that will compose your consignment based on the pricing configured
- Automate part of your consignment process, such as deviation detection and handling
- Manage consignment proposals that will be a draft of the shipment you will create on your system
- Manage the consignment process, such as deviation detection and handling
- Manage the consignment proposals that will be a draft of the shipment you will create on your system
