# Introduction

A transportation/vehicle that will carry the consignment(s), that we book with a carrier company, and has price and capacity (loading unity type). Shipment can have more than one pick up and one drop off location and can carry multiple consignments

In the context of this solution, we call those products and services that will compose a shipment - such as a consignment - "[Consignable Units](#consignable-units)". Check [here](#currently-supported-types-of-consignable-units) what are the current supported types of Consignable Units.

In short, this solution will help you:

- Create a shipment with multiple consignments
- Track the status of the shipment
- Manage the prices associated with its cost calculations

To know more in details about how the Shipment works, refer to [How it works](#how-it-works).

To see concrete usages of the solution, go to [Practical examples](#sample-use-cases)

If you already have a good understanding about the core concepts of this solution, you can go directly to the [technical API definition](#api-definition) and start using that.
